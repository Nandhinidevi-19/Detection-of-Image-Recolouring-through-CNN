# Detection of Image Recolouring through CNN

This project is a full-stack machine learning web application that detects whether an image has been recolored or not using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Users can upload an image through a web interface, and the system predicts whether the image is recolored based on a trained CNN model.
