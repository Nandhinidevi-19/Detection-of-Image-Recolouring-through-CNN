# Detection of Image Recolouring through CNN

This project is a machine learning–based web application that detects whether an image has been recoloured or not using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Users can upload an image through a web interface, and the system predicts whether the image is recoloured based on a trained CNN model.
